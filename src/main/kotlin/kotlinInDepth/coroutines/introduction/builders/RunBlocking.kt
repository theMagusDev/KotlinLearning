/*
The runBlocking() builder, on the other hand creates a coroutine
which by default executes in the current thread and blocks until it
completes. When coroutine returns successfully, the return value of the
suspend lambda becomes the value of the entire runBlocking() call. When
the coroutine is cancelled, runBlocking() throws an exception

/*
`runBlocking()` shouldn't be used inside other coroutines. Itâ€™s
intended as a kind of bridge between blocking and non-blocking
code and can be used, for example, as a top-level builder in
the main function or tests.
