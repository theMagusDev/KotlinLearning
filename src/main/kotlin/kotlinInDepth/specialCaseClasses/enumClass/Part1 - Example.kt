// Enums are somewhat similar to object declarations in a sense that they
//define a set of global constants representing instances of a particular type.
//Similarly to objects, they are not permitted in contexts where there is no
//guarantee that such a definition can be available as a global constant. You
//canâ€™t, for example, put an enum definition into an inner class or function
//body:

fun program2() {
    // enum class Test { A, B, C, D } // Error
}

/* Main function */
fun main() {
    program1()
}
