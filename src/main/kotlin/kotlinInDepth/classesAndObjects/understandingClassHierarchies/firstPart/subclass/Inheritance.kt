/* Java vs Kotlin
 1) In Kotlin there are no special keywords like extends and
implements in Java. Instead inheritance is always denoted by colon symbol (:).
 2) In Kotlin all classes and functions are final by default.
If you want to inherit/override them, you should mark them as 'open'.
 3) Note the parentheses added after Vehicle and FlyingVehicle in the
definitions of their subclasses. This is in fact a call to the superclass
constructor where you put necessary arguments to the super class
initialization code.

/* Some classes do not support inheritance to the full extent. In particular:

 1) Data classes are always final and canâ€™t be declared as open:
open data class Person(val name: String, val age: Int) // Error: Modifier 'open' is incompatible with 'data'

 2) Value (Inline) classes can not inherit and be inherited by other classes:
@JvmInline
open value class Dollar(val amount: Int) // Error: Value classes can be only final
value class Dollar(val amount: Int) : Any() // Error: Value class cannot extend classes
