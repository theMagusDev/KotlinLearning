// run() //

// When we use run, it sounds like:
// "Do some work with a certain object"

/* Features:

* Is an extension function.
* Context object is available as 'this'.
* Returns the result of a lambda.

run() does the same as with() but invokes
as let() - as an extension function of the context object.

Use when:

/*
    1) First, when we want to initialize a new object and pass the result
    of a lambda to it. It is important â€” our new object is independent and
    valuable, unlike in the case of the with() function.
